## Current migration state

```text
118 spool <-> MaterialLedger bridge persistence
119 authoritative wire metadata
120 explicit operator bridge creation
121 atomic RUN_WIRE transaction/recovery
122 desktop/mobile operator writeoff migrated to atomic RUN_WIRE
123 costing/finalization accounting converged: RUN_WIRE counted once
124 bounded cross-log RUN_WIRE integrity
125 one KG wire price + reserved system accounting provenance
126 direct exact spool provenance in new RUN_WIRE movements + legacy POST 410 deprecation
```

New RUN_WIRE Material Request movement records expose exact `spool_id` directly. The store derives it from immutable `JobSpoolSelection`; callers cannot substitute another spool. Historical records without this field remain valid and are resolved through the immutable selection.

Public `POST /api/warehouse/write-offs` is permanently fail-closed with HTTP 410 and replacement `/api/material-requests/warehouse`. `GET /api/warehouse/write-offs` remains for history/coverage, and low-level warehouse recovery remains intact.

## Immediate NEXT

1. Extend `RunWireAccountingIntegrityAudit` to validate directly persisted `spool_id` when present, while accepting historical RUN_WIRE movements without it.
2. Keep the audit bounded; do not add redundant full-log scans.
3. Continue bounded read/report provenance improvements.
4. Review whether low-level legacy writeoff APIs can be narrowed further without breaking history/recovery.
5. Continue software work before final two-board hardware E2E.

## Material safety

`RUN_COMPLETED` never automatically deducts material. Warehouse mutation requires explicit operator action and exact Material Request / spool / session / run provenance.

## General safety invariants

- physical START local-only;
- no automatic START between repeats;
- no auto-resume after reboot;
- Arduino owns SSR;
- ESP32/Web never directly control SSR;
- lost ACK/timeout never proves Arduino idle;
- final repeat cannot auto-reopen;
- cancellation/operator abort preserves immutable evidence;
- restore operator-only, transactional, fail-closed;
- backup/restore is blocked while RUN_WIRE recovery intent exists;
- no automatic production deletion/truncation.

## Working discipline

Before modifying an existing file: fetch exact `cmp-protocol-v1` content + current blob SHA. Before a new path: confirm 404. Never claim GREEN without actual CI/build evidence.
